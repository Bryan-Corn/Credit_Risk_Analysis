# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17 Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict credit risk using machine learning. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Employing different techniques is needed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. This project uses the following algorithms to determine credit risk from analyzing LendingClub data:

~~~
• Naive Random Oversampling
• SMOTE Oversampling
• ClusterCentroids Undersampling
• SMOTEEN Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
• Balanced Random Forest Classifier
• Easy Ensemble Classifier
~~~
